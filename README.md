# Crypto

## Purpose

Build a library of functions manipulating polynomials on the F_2 core (Polynomials in F_2)

From easy to hard :

- Multiplication of Polynomials
- Adding to Polynomials
- Euclidian Division between two Polynomials
- Increasing power division between two Polynomials
- Troncate an Polynomial
- Modular Exponentiation
- Primality test (Erathostene's crible)
- Primitivity test (X generator of F_2[X]/P for P primal).
- Berkelamp-massey's Algorithm

## How to compile

Simply run :
```
make
```
The program will then run itself once

## How to run

Simply run
```
./main
```

## How to clean

Simply run :
```
make clean
```

## How to generate documentation

Simply run :
```
make doc
```
Documentation will then be available in the `documentation` folder.
